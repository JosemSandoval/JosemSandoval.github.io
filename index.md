### CPSC 120

### Reflection 1: 

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 2 was an interesting and favorite lab because of the usage of && for 
    this lab. It was certainly easier to understand why && was used in our loop once
    the slides explained it. The lab, however, was difficult due to the loops providing 
    errors due to forgetting .length after the schedule variables. It was fun working
    identifying the problem loops and being able to complete the lab. 

### Reflection 2: 

* Lab 12 

    Lab 12, part 1 was my favorite lab of the semester because we were able to code 
    colors. Using RGB values and reading into other files, I was able to code an 
    animated color image. The colors moved across the screen and I never thought, that being
    able to code would mean colors could be included as well. The difficult
    part was getting one of the functions to read from other files and still work properly.

### Reflection 3: 

* Lab 8 

    Lab 8, part 1 was actually a favorite because we were coding a user's 
    sandwich ingredients. I was able to code a Mad Libs game, which consisted
    of 4 index arguments, 3 main ingredient ones, and print out a message with these 
    words put in the blanks. Being able to code small, fun games like these make
    the labs more fun to code and complete. This helped out with other labs
    as well due to knowing much more about arguments.

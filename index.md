### CPSC 120

### Refletion 1: 

* Lab 1
    
    Lab 1, part 1 was one of my favorites because it was an introdcution to 
    C++ for me. It allowed me to print out my first message to the world. It 
    also helped me learn about the std library and and what printing a message 
    looks like for future projects. 
 
* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 2 was one of my favorites because this time we had to use different 
    files to incorporate our functions. The assignment required us to find how many 
    feet, inches, and eighths of inches there are in a given double number. The lab 
    had incorporated using doubles and getting them back in order to give the user 
    a full calculation of feet, inches, and eighths of inches.

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 2 was an interesting and favorite lab because of the usage of && for 
    this lab. It was certainly easier to understand why && was used in our loop once
    the slides explained it. The lab, however, was difficult due to the loops providing 
    errors due to forgetting .lenght after the schedule variables. It was fun working
    idnetifying the problem loops and being able to complete the lab. 

### Reflection 2: 

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 1 was one of my favorite labs because arguments were very fun
    to learn and use. I was able to use strings to integer functions (stoi)
    to convert our string variables into actual dates. Datedifference had multiple
    parameters in it, our start and end values, that were turned declared as arguments 
    and turned to integers using stoi.

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 1 actually was one of my favorites because pizza is good to eat and 
    code about. I was able to use a given diameter and radius and division equations
    to find the amount of dollars per square inch for a pizza! Using an approximate value
    of pi to find the official unit price of a pizza. I liked how we could use different
    values used to get a price based off the pizza size, which is also funny.

* Lab 12 

    Lab 12, part 1 was my favorite lab of the semester because we were able to code 
    colors. Using RGB values and reading into other files, I was able to code an 
    animated color image. The colors moved across the screen and I never thought, that being
    able to code would mean colors could be included as well. The difficult
    part was getting one of the functions to read from other files and still work properly.

### Reflection 3: 

* Lab 10 

    Lab 10, part 2 was one of my favorites because this code had all California
    counties and the population in them, which looks so cool. I was able to use 
    a string that was a California county and print the county population from the 2D vector. 
    I found it cool that a user can input just one word from the vector and the population that's
    in that argument slot would be printed out. 

* Lab 8 

    Lab 8, part 1 was actually a favorite because we were coding a user's 
    sandwich ingredients. I was able to code a Mad Libs game, which consisted
    of 4 index arguments, 3 main ingredient ones, and print out a message with these 
    words put in the blanks. Being able to code small, fun games like these make
    the labs more fun to code and complete. This helped out with other labs
    as well due to knowing much more about arguments. 

* Lab 4

    Lab 4. part 2 was a favorite lab because we coded a minigame called Hi-Lo, where
    the one of the players have to choose a number another one chose, and if they get
    it wrong, a hint would be given whether the number is higher or lower. In this lab, 
    I was able to incorporate if statements in order to figure out whether the second 
    player was right or wrong, then give a hint if it was wrong.
